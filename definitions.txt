here is a compiled list of computer science definitions.

scalar objects - have a type that defines the kinds of things programs can do to them, cannot be subdivided (ints, floats, bools, NoneType)
non-scalar objects - have a type that defines the kinds of things program can do to them, have internal structure that can be accessed
program - a sedqience of definitions and commands
primitive constructs - numbers, strings, simple operators
syntax - that parsing of a sentence to know, is this a legal sentence or not
static semantics - tells us which syntactically valid strings actually have meaning
full semantics - the meaning associated with a syntactically correct string of symbols with no static semantic errors
int - represent integers (whole numbers)
float - represent real numbers (numbers with a decimal place after them)
bool - represent Boolean values True and False
operator - special symbols in Python that carry out arithmetic or logical computation
expression - more complex but legal combinations of primitives that the programming language will recognize; combine objects and operators to form expressions; an expression has a value which has a type; syntax for a simple expression: <object> <operator> <object>
definitions - are evaluated
commands - executed by Python interpreter in a shell, instruct interpreter to do something
algorithm - a "recipe" in this course, or, a logical sequence of events
variables - (bindings) are descriptive, meaningful, helps you re-read code, cannot be keywords, information is stored and can be updated
concatenate - the operation of joining character strings end-to-end
string - a sequence of characters enclosed within single or double quotation marks
