lesson 1 notes

6 primitives are the least amount required to compute anything. those are (move left, move right, scan, print, write, do nothing)

some definitions that will be nice to learn and use in proper dialogue.

scalar objects - have a type that defines the kinds of things programs can do to them, cannot be subdivided
non-scalar objects - have a type that defines the kinds of things program can do to them, have internal structure that can be accessed
program - a sedqience of definitions and commands
primitive constructs - numbers, strings, simple operators
syntax - that parsing of a sentence to know, is this a legal sentence or not
static semantics - tells us which syntactically valid strings actually have meaning
full semantics - the meaning associated with a syntactically correct string of symbols with no static semantic errors
boolean - 
operator - 
expression - more complex but legal combinations of primitives that the programming language will recognize
definitions - are evaluated
commands - executed by Python interpreter in a shell, instruct interpreter to do something
evaluation - 
algorithm - a "recipe" in this course, or, a logical sequence of events
