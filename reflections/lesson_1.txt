lesson 1 notes

6 primitives are the least amount required to compute anything. those are (move left, move right, scan, print, write, do nothing)

some definitions that will be nice to learn and use in proper dialogue.
primitive constructs - numbers, strings, simple operators
syntax - that parsing of a sentence to know, is this a legal sentence of not
static semantics - 
full semantics - 
boolean - 
operator - 
expression - more complex but legal combinations of primitives that the programming language will recognize.
evaluation - 
algorithm - a "recipe" in this course, or, a logical sequence of events
