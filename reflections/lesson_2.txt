1. )	Define a function which takes user input.
2. )	Convert user input to an integer.
3. )	Save converted input to a variable.
4. )	Define another variable and set it to zero.
5. )	Start a while loop.
6. )	Make the range function call the saved variables.
7. )	Make the variable subtract from itself whatever number is currently in the while loop.
8. )	Insert an IF statement.
9. )	Make the IF statment compare the saved "zero" variable against any integer
10.)	If it evaluates to true, tell it to print the saved variable as a string.
11.)	Concatenate strings so the IF statement prints a space between the first and second strings.
11.)	Print to console "this was an IF statement!"
12.)	Insert an ELIF statment.
13.)	Make the ELIF statment compare the saved "zero" variable against "1"
14.)	If it evaluates to true, tell it to print the saved variable as a string.
15.)	Concatenate strings so the ELIF statement prints a space between the first and second strings.
16.)	Print to console "this was an ELIF statement!"
17.)	Insert a 2nd ELIF statment.
18.)	Make the ELIF statment compare the saved "zero" variable against "-1"
19.)	If it evaluates to true, tell it to print the saved variable as a string.
20.)	Concatenate strings so the ELIF statement prints a space between the first and second strings.
21.)	Print to console "this was the 2nd ELIF statement!"
22.)	Insert an ELSE statment.
23.)	Concatenate strings so the ELSE statement prints a space between the first and second strings.
24.)	Print to console "this was the ELSE statement!"
