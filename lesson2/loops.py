# this is a practice WHILE LOOP assigned to a function.

# DO NOT FORGET YOUR COLON WHILE ASSIGNING A FUNCTION!!!!!

# It appears we can't have a double argument in a function.

# The current way the program is written, it will not run..

# It returns a syntax error on the double 'int' argument

## WHY WOULD YOU NEED TWO ARGUMENTS?????!!!??

## YOU DON'T NEED ANY ARGUMENTS aka ZERO ARGUMENTS . . . watch.
